# Advent of Code 2023!

Another year, another wild ride from pleasant one liners through to enjoyable small challenges
through to head scratchers through to oh God when will it end through to yeah maybe finish this
one later in the year when I'm not so tired.

I'm using Rust again. Just because I still really enjoy writing it, and still have much to learn.
Dependencies are allowed this year, within reason - nom, serde, rand etc. Why not.

# New dawn, new day

- Each day can now be boilerplated via [cargo-generate](https://github.com/dwalker109/aoc-input).
- [aocfin](https://github.com/dwalker109/aoc-input) can be used to pull the day's input.
- Inputs are stored in a [private submodule](https://github.com/dwalker109/aoc-input) mounted under `./input`, pointing at the `aoc-2023` branch.

# Days!

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

This was a surprisingly involved first day. Is 2023 going to be hard as nails?
It wasn't massively difficult, and maybe I'm just still asleep (I got up at 5am),
but this took me an hour. Day 1 is usually pretty much a one liner, and this one
wasn't.
